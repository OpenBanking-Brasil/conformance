# Open Banking Brasil Certification

The Open Banking Brasil Initial Structure enables deployments of Open Banking Brasil Services and the Open Banking Brasil Consent and Authorisation Process to be certificed to specific conformance profiles to promote interoperability among implementations. This process utilizes self-certification and conformance test suites developed by Raidiam Services Ltd at the request of the Open Banking Brasil Initial Structure. This test suite and process leverages the tooling and processes published under MIT License by the Open ID Foundation to whom we give thanks for the significant effort and foundational contributions that have enabled this test suite to be developed.
